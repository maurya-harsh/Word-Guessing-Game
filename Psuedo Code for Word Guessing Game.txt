1. START the program

2. SHOW welcome message and rules

3. LET user choose a difficulty level
	a. Based on level, set a list of possible secret words

4. RANDOMLY select a secret word from the chosen list

5. TELL the user how many letters are in the secret word

6. SET attempt counter to 0

7. WHILE the user hasn't guessed the word:
	a. ASK user to enter a guess
	b. INCREMENT attempt counter
	c. IF guess equals secret word:
		i. PRINT "Congratulations!" and show attempts
		ii. BREAK loop
	d. ELSE:
		i. COMPARE each letter in the guess to the secret word
		ii. COUNT how many letters are correct and in the correct place
5. Possible Stretch Goals
	Limit the number of guesses.
	Show all past guesses.
	Give more detailed hints (e.g., which letters are correct).
	Add a "play again" feature.
	import random



	#1. Define password lists by difficulty
easy_words = ["apple", "train", "tiger", "money", "india"]
medium_words = ["python", "bottle", "monkey", "planet", "laptop"]
hard_words = ["elephant", "diamond", "umbrella", "computer", "mountain"]
	print("Welcome to the Password Guessing Game!")
	print("Choose a difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard")

	#2. User chooses difficulty
level = input("Enter difficulty: ").lower()
if level == "easy":
secret = random.choice(easy_words)
elif level == "medium":
secret = random.choice(medium_words)
elif level = "hard":
secret = random.choice(hard_words)
else:
print("Invalid choice. Defaulting to easy level.")
secret = random.choice(easy_words)
attempts = 0
print("\nGuess the secret password!")

	#3. Game loop
while True:
guess = input("Enter your guess: ").lower()
attempts += 1
if guess == secret:
print(f"Congratulations! You guessed it in {attempts} attempts.")
break

	#4. Give a hint: show which letters are correct (like Wordle)
hint =
for i in range(len(secret)):
if i < len(guess) and guess [i] == secret[i]:
hint += guess[i]
else:
hint += " "
print("Hint: " + hint)
print("Game Over.")
