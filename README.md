* **Three Difficulty Levels**: Choose between **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**, each with a unique list of words.
* **Dynamic Hints**: After each incorrect guess, the game provides a hint showing correctly placed letters.
* **Attempt Counter**: Tracks how many guesses it takes you to find the secret word.

    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Run the game from your terminal:**
    ```bash

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* **Python 3.x**

No external packages are needed to run this game, as it only uses Python's built-in `random` module.

## üí° Future Improvements

This is a simple project with lots of room for improvement! Here are a few ideas:

* **Add a life system** (e.g., limit the player to 6 guesses).
* **Implement a "Play Again"** feature after a game ends.
* **Expand the word lists** or pull words from an external file or API.
* **Create a GUI** version using a library like Tkinter or Pygame.
